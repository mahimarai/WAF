Machine learning based Web Application firewall for detection attacks such as SQL injections, XSS injection and other payloads.

## Requirement:
- Python==3.9.2
- numpy==1.20.1
- matplotlib==3.3.4
- pickle==4.0
- sklearn==0.24.1
- flask==1.1.2

## Steps to run the code:
Step 1: Have an offline text editor or jupyter notebook having installed all the required versions of python and itâ€™s library.
(I have made two pickle files. One contains binary format of trained model so no need to train again and another contains the feature engineered data in binary format. Hence no need to train again, you can proceed with running the model on a local host.)

Step 2: Run app.py file.
In windows, press ctrl+Windows to open cmd(Command Prompt) and then run python app.py

Step 3: A link will appear in the cmd, rum it as local host.
